* TAILWIND GUIDE:

-> min-h-screen

Tells the container:
“Have at least the height of the entire viewport.”

This ensures the background color covers 100% of the screen, even if there’s very little content.

-> bg-gray-50 and dark:bg-gray-900

These set background colors from Tailwind’s default palette.

-> bg-gray-50 → very light gray
-> dark:bg-gray-900 → near-black

dark: prefix = applies when the page is in dark mode

Dark mode in Tailwind is class-based by default. When your HTML tag has class="dark", all dark:* utilities kick in.

-> text-gray-900 and dark:text-gray-100

Same idea as background, but for text color.

-> text-gray-900 → almost black text

-> dark:text-gray-100 → very light text in dark mode
This keeps reading contrast acceptable.

Padding:


-> p-4, p-6, p-3

Padding classes.

Tailwind’s spacing scale works like this:

p-0 → 0px

p-1 → 4px

p-2 → 8px

p-3 → 12px

p-4 → 16px

p-6 → 24px

…and so on.


You can also do side-specific ones:

px-4 → padding left/right

py-4 → padding top/bottom

-> border-b

A bottom border.
Tailwind assumes:

width: 1px

style: solid

color: current text color unless you specify otherwise

Margin: 

-> mr-4

Margin-right of 1rem (16px).
Useful to space nav links apart.

-> text-2xl, text-xl

Font size utilities.
Tailwind sizes aren't just pixel values—they include line-height defaults too.

For example:

text-xl → 20px-ish
text-2xl → 24px-ish

Exact values depend on Tailwind’s theme.

font-semibold

Sets font-weight to around 600.
Heavier than normal text but lighter than bold.

-> mb-4, mb-3, mb-2

Margin-bottom utilities.
Good for stacking headings, cards, list items.

bg-white

White background. Useful for cards or containers that sit on a gray background.

rounded

Border-radius.
Default is 0.25rem (4px).


You also get:

rounded-md
rounded-lg
rounded-full
shadow

A small box-shadow.


Tailwind gives you several levels:

shadow-sm
shadow -> DEFAULT
shadow-md
shadow-lg

shadow is the default moderate one.

EXAMPLE:

<div className="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow">
Translated:

Padding: 16px
Background: white
Corners: slightly rounded
Shadow: small drop-shadow
